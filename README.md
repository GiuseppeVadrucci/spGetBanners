# spGetBanners

The project is not finished, the handlers file contains the func to get data from the db, in the directory struct there is the struct of the banners and the json elements.The main files contains the results elements ( json, xml .... ), the output of the service. The server file is a new instance of the echo server.
I did a db file, in wich i created the table and a procedure with the input parameters, i'm not sure i need it. This is not finished, there are errors. I did this in 2 hour.
