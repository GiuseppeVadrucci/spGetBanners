# spGetBanners

The project is not finished, the handlers file contains the func to get data from the db, the struct of the banners and the json elements. The main file contains the struct of the banner, the server file is a new instance of the echo server.
I did a db file, in wich i created the table and a procedure with the input parameters. This is not finished, there are errors. I did this in 1 hour.
